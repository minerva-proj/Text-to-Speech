# Text-to-Speech

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text to Speech Synthesis (TTS) have been implemented using Raspberry Pi 3. OCR technology converts the captured text images to editable text, whereas the TTS technology scanns the alphanumeric characters in the processed image and converted them to speech.


The above technoogy was used to develope a device. The research artile was published in IGI Global, USA (https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/development-of-a-text-to-speech-scanner-for-visually-impaired-people/206296).

The aim of this study was to develop a text to speech device that is portable, inexpensive, and user-friendly and can overcome all these problems and provide an economical and handy alternative. The prototype of the proposed device has been implemented using Raspberry Pi, which is a small computer. In the prototype model, a Pi camera has been used for capturing the required image. The device reads the textual material in front of the user. It captures the image of the textual material, removes noise and marking the area of interest converts it into text, which is then converted into voice. The device is quite facile and does not require any special training, which makes it easy for any person to use it. All they need to do is keep the text in an appropriate range so proper image can be captured by the camera. And this device can also be used by people with normal vision so as to avoid straining their eyes.

# Usage
The python file can be run in laptop as well as in Raspberry Pi.
